# Requirements
* [X-Plane 12](https://www.x-plane.com/) as I'm not testing this in X-Plane 11
* [Felis 747-200 for X-Plane 12](https://store.x-plane.org/Boeing-747-200-Classic_p_1491.html)

* [Yawman Arrow Controller](https://yawmanflight.com/)

# Installation
Note that the current script does not modify your axes. You'll need to set up your Yawman Arrow's axes as you like.

Save _Felis B742 Yawman Multipress.lua_ to /X-Plane 12/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts

Assignments closely matches Yawman's PMDG 777 mappings. See their [discord](https://discord.gg/dcpTc5KP).
