# Installation
Note that the current script does not modify your axes. You'll need to set up your Yawman Arrow's axes as you like.

Save to /X-Plane 12/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts

For now, you'll need to read the script to understand what buttons operate. I'll add mapping details at a later date. But it closely matches Yawman's PMDG 777 mappings. See their (https://discord.gg/dcpTc5KP)[discord].
